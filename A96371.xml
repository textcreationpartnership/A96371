            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>What Meditation is.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST, It differs from occaſionall Meditation, ſuch as theſe; If one hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the clock ſtrike to think with ones ſelf, how many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170278:8"/>thoughts have I had of God this hour? 2. I am one hour nearer my grave, and the Lord onely knows whether I may have another hour to live or no.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe are farre ſhorter, like ejaculatory praiers, which though they are as Parentheſiſes in our worldly employments, yet they ſignifie more then all the reſt of the buſineſſe we are emploied in, but meditation is generally of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger duration then ordinary ſolemn praier.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such occaſional Meditations are things that we have <hi>in tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,</hi> and this that I ſpeak of is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſet duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Subject from which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionall Meditations ariſe, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently things artificiall, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or naturall, indeed any thing that we ſee or hear; but the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170278:8"/>of Meditation are onely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It differs from ſtudy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the Subject, Wicked men ſtudy, and it may be more then Godly men; Wicked men ſtudy, and Godly men medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; Nay it is the very diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſigne between Saints and others, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1.2. and I beleeve 'tis a thing far more rare for a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Chriſtian to be an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, then for a Chriſtian that ſpends much time in praier, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be publike.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the matter of praier and ſtudy they are very different. 1. Study is of all manner of things, whether naturall, civill, mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Meditation is onely of matters that concern our eternall welfare. 2. The matters that we moſt ſtudy are thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170278:9"/>Truths that are moſt knotty and difficult, and generally ſuch as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford little ſpirituall nouriſhment, as Criticiſmes, Chronologies, Controverſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Meditation is plain and of great ſpiritual advantage. 3. The end of Study is knowledge, the end of Meditation is holineſſe: If one ſees a Learned man, one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that that man hath ſtudied much; If one ſees a devout holy man, one may conclude, that that man hath meditated much.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It differs from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Contemplation is more like the beatificall Viſion which they have of God in Heaven, like the Angels beholding of the face of God; Meditation is like the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of fire, and Contemplation more like the flaming of it when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170278:9"/>fully kindled: The one is like the Spouſes ſeeking of Chriſt, and the other like the Spouſes enjoying of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Contemplation is one effect and end of Meditation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation is like the Bees flying to ſeverall flowers, or one ſmelling to flowers particularly or ſeverally; and Contemplation is like the ſmelling of them all in a Noſegay, or like the water that is diſtilled from them all. The Spouſe in her deſcription of Chriſt is like to Meditation, her conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he is altogether lovely is like to Contemplation; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to conclude, Meditation is a ſerious ſolemn thinking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of the things of God, to the end we might underſtand how much they concern us, and that our hearts thereby may be raiſed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170278:10"/>to ſome holy affections and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.</p>
               <p>Now there are four kindes of ſolemn Meditation according to the four ſeverall Subjects of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some ſolemn Meditations are on Sermons that we hear, which is a very uſefull and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practice for Chriſtians; and it is better to hear one Sermon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and meditate on it, then to hear two, and meditate of neither; but for ſetting down a method for meditating on Sermons, is neither neceſſary nor poſſible, ſince the method of Sermons are various, and they are to obſerve in their Meditation the method of the Sermon they meditate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; All that I ſhall ſay therefore in this particular, is onely this, that the end of ſuch Meditations is neither onely, nor chiefly, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170278:10"/>we may the better fix the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and heads of the Sermon in our memory, nor that we may the better underſtand and fuller be inſtructed of the truth of that point that is preacht upon, but eſpecially to work thoſe truths, advices, and motives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon our affections that are propoſed to us in the Sermon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond kinde of Solemn Meditation is, when upon ſome providentiall occaſion, or upon ſpiritual diſtemper or temptation, or almoſt any thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we retire our ſelves, and powr out our ſouls in Prayers, Soliloquies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may not but in a very large ſenſe be called prayer, being mixt of ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and different parts; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeaking to God, and telling him how we ſtand affected to him
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170278:11"/>and his Ordinances, ſometimes ſpeaking to our own ſoul, chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, encouraging, or inſtructing of it; Sometimes ſpeaking to our ſelves, what we reſolve to doe, what we intend to ſay to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all theſe you may finde in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 42. and many more of that nature, both in that and other Pſalmes, which may not properly be called prayers, but ſolemn occaſional Meditations, and the occaſions of thoſe Meditations are ſet down ofttimes in the beginning of the Pſalme; and they differ from thoſe occaſional Meditations of which I ſpoke in the beginning of this Chapter, only in their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſolemnity, as ſolemn praiers do from ejaculatory pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and to ſet down any method for theſe is not convenient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they obſerve no method, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170278:11"/>differ very little in any thing elſe from that kinde of Meditation for which in this Treatiſe Directions and Inſtances are largely ſet down; yet I thought good to ſet down ſeveral Inſtances of this kinde of Meditations, having them by me, being taken from one who I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe little thought that any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God and himſelf knew what he ſaid.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third kinde of ſolemn Meditation are thoſe that are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture, the directions for that kinde of Meditation I have particularly ſet down in a little Manuall entituled, <hi>A Directory to Chriſtian Perfection,</hi> and have purſued thoſe Directions in one inſtance, ſet down in this Treatiſe, and would have ſet down more but that I was not willing it ſhould ſwell above the bigneſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170278:12"/>of a ſmall Manuall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt kinde of Meditation is upon ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call truth of Religon, many dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for which, and many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which are ſet down in this Treatiſe.</p>

From the practice of Gods people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.63. that this was a ſolemn Meditation is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, becauſe he went out into the fields to perform it, and had no other buſineſſe there but this; 'Tis not ſaid when he was in the field he meditated, as if it were occaſionall, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170278:12"/>to ſhew that it was a ſet duty, 'tis ſaid that <hi>he went out to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis commanded <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.8. and this duty of Meditation is ſet down as a chief means ſanctified of God for the keeping of the Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is as a Characteriſtical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a wicked man and a Saint.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To conſider in Scripture and to meditate are Synonima's, and the neceſſity of it appears in this, becauſe that the cauſe of ſinne is the want of conſideration and not want of knowledge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. and 'tis not much for us to hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, nay, though we be never ſo attentive, it will not ſerve the turn, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 45.10. It is more then to know, for who is there almoſt in the world that knows not that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170278:13"/>he muſt die, but how few are there that conſider it? <hi>Deu.</hi> 32.29.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The neceſſity of Meditation appears in this, that no man is converted without Meditation; for every one that is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the method is this. 1. He hears the Truths of God. 2. He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, of them. 3. He conſiders and meditates upon them, and ſees how much they concern him. 4. He is affected with them. 5. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus affected it raiſeth holy reſolutions of better obedience.</p>
               <p>But it will be Objected, alas, I am not Book-learned, how ſhall I perform this duty of Meditation? This is rather for Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I may ſay of Meditation as 'tis ſaid of the Mathematicks, He that is a rational man, and doth but improve his reaſon, though he hath neither tongues nor arts to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170278:13"/>help him, may underſtand and grow to an extraordinary excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in thoſe Arts; So he that hath grace, if he do but exerciſe and improve it, though he hath not learning, will excell the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edeſt man in the world that hath not grace in the duty of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; 'tis not learning but devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that enables a man to this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can a man be a bleſſed man without Learning? then he may meditate without it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 1.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But 'tis a very hard Duty,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That ſhews it to be an excellent duty, for the harder any duty is, the more excellent; the hardneſſe conſiſts in this, that 'tis contrary to our corruptions, and the more contrary any thing is to that which is bad, 'tis ſo much the better.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170278:14"/>
               <p n="2">2. Can you expect any duty ſhould be eaſie at firſt? Is there any thing ſo of temporall things which are of any excellency, as Writing, Playing on the Lute, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe 'tis ſo powerfull to mortifie corruptions; ſweet things nouriſh, and bitter things purge: therefore if you will only perform thoſe duties that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, they will nouriſh not purge out corruption.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Get but your hearts inflamed with the love of God, then this duty will not only be eaſie and delightful, but it will be a duty that you cannot tell almoſt how to avoid, for it is as hard not to think of what one loves as to think of what one hates; Bid the covetous man not think of his money, or bid him think of the things of God, and he will finde
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170278:14"/>an equall difficulty in both. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the love of God and deſire of heavenly things are got by Meditation, but when once our hearts are enflamed by Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then our Meditations are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by love: As an Oven is firſt heated by fewell, and then it ſets the ſewell on fire, and as with the fewel you muſt put in fire and blow it, but afterwards it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of it ſelf, ſo the difficulty of Meditation is at firſt: when there is but as it were a ſpark of love in the heart, it will coſt him ſome pains by meditation to blow it up to a flame, but afterwards the heart will be ſo heated with theſe flames of love, that it will ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame all the thoughts, that it will make us not only eaſily but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to meditate on the things of God.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170278:15"/>
               <p n="5">5. The people of God general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have found a great deale of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in praying without a form at firſt. Many godly Miniſters us'd a ſet Form Form of Prayer before their Sermons not many years ſince, and when they and private Chriſtians came to pray at firſt without a Form, they found a ſtrangeneſſe and an unreadineſſe thereunto; So it is in Meditation, Chriſtians being not us'd to it, it will ſeem a ſtrange and difficult work unto them, but I may ſay of it as it is ſaid of the yoke of Chriſt, <hi>Grave cùm tollis, ſuavè cùm tuleris,</hi> thou wilt finde it very delightfull or at leaſt very profitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But if it be ſuch a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty, how comes it to paſs that it hath been ſo generally neglected by the peo-ple of God.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:170278:15"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It hath been practiſed by the people of God both in Scripture, as is proved, (and it is evident that the Pſalmes of <hi>David</hi> are frequently nothing but Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, though not in this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod) and by many in our daies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It being a private Cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty, the omiſſion nor perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it could be taken notice of, and ſo the omiſſion of it could not be reproved nor performance obſerved.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Preparatory Directions concerning ſome Circumſtances belonging to Meditation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. FOR the place, that muſt be private, remote from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and noiſe; <hi>Iſaac went into the fields,</hi> our Saviour into a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and <hi>David</hi> wiſheth us to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our Chamber, and be ſtill.</hi> Pſa. 4.4. and our Saviour bids us <hi>enter into our Cloſet, and ſhut the door,</hi> the place muſt be ſuch as muſt be remote from noiſe and company, or any thing which might diſtract us in the duty; and ſuch a place that we may not be interrupted or forced to break off, before the duty be ended, it muſt be alſo private and remote from the obſervation of others, ſo that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170278:16"/>we may neither be heard nor ſeen, becauſe there are divers geſtures and expreſſions, which are not convenient for any one but God and ones own ſoul to be privy to: Which of thoſe places you finde to be moſt advantagious to you in the matters of Meditation you may chooſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Time when; The beſt is in the morning. 1. Becauſe it is the firſt-fruits of the day, and the firſt-fruits being holy, all the reſt are ſanctified. 2. Becauſe our thoughts being then not ſoyled with worldly buſineſſe, will not be ſo ſubject to be diſtracted. 3. Becauſe the body it ſelf is more ſerene then after meals, and this duty needs an empty ſtomack, not only becauſe the head will be more clear and fit for Meditation, but alſo becauſe many paſſages of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170278:17"/>require ſo much intention of the minde and ſervency of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that they do hinder dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. 4. Becauſe that it being in the morning will have an influence upon the whole day, but this is not an univerſall rule; for we reade that <hi>Iſaac</hi> went forth in the evening to meditate, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.63. and in caſe the ſubject of your Meditation be a Sermon, then if it may be the beſt time is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after the hearing of it before your affections cool, or your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory fail you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the how long, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the parts of Meditation are ſo many, <hi>viz.</hi> preparation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, affections, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and none of them are to be paſt ſlightly over, for affections are not quickly raiſed, nor are we to ceaſe blowing the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170278:17"/>fire as ſoon as ever it begin to flame, until it be well kindled, half an hour may be thought to be the leaſt for beginners, and an hour for thoſe that are verſed in this duty; But there are two rules in this particular eſpecially to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. 1. That as we ought not to leave off our praiers before that temper and frame of heart is wrought, which is ſutable to the matter of our prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> we ſhould not leave off the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne till our hearts are made ſenſible of and humble for our ſinnes, nor ſhould we leave off our praiſes until our hearts are filled with holy admirings and adorings of God, and inflamed with his love; So the end of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation being affections and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, we ſhould not leave off until thoſe are wrought. 2. As in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170278:18"/>private prayer, ſo long as we finde our hearts enlarged by the pourings of the Spirit of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon us, we are not to leave off unleſſe by our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that duty we muſt omit another duty to which we were more particularly obliged at that time; So in Meditation as long as we finde the heart affected we are to continue it: But this Caution muſt be given, that in ſuch enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we muſt not continue them longer generally then while they come freely and without much ſtraining and compulſion, for that honey that comes freely of it ſelf from the comb is pure, but that which is forced by heat and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is not ſo well relliſhed, but this Caution is for extraordinary enlargements, for if the heart be dead, we muſt uſe all means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170278:18"/>it; But as fire muſt be blown till it be well kindled, but afterwards blowing hinders the boyling of any thing that is ſet over it, So when once our hearts are inflamed and enlarged with holy affections in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, 'tis but a hinderance to our affections to return to the Meditation of thoſe Points that raiſed them.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. BY no means let it be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, for that will turn Meditation into Study.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Let the Subject of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the plaineſt, powerfulleſt, and uſefulleſt Truths of God, as death, hell, heaven, judgement, mercies of God, our own ſinnes, the Love and Sufferings of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Rules for Meditation it ſelf, they are of three ſorts. 1. Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory. 2. For the body of the

               <p>Two things by way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration beſides the choice of the Subject, the firſt is to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of and to be affected with the preſence of God: The ſecond is praier for aſſiſtance from God. 2. For the body of Meditation it ſelf, it conſiſts of three parts; The firſt I call Conſideration, which is nothing but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing our hearts of ſeverall Truths that belong to that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereof we meditate: As as if the ſubject of our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be death, the conſiderations may go thus, alas O my Soul, how, and when, and where we ſhall die we know not, generally men die ſooner then they expect, and certain it is, whenſoever that hour comes, we muſt bid adieu to honours, pleaſures, riches, friends,

Becauſe it is not artificiall and ſuch as requires Learning, as thoſe Directions are which wiſh us to conſider the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, finall, formall, materiall cauſe of death, the adjuncts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which though they may ſomewhat help the learned, yet ſuch hard words and artificial methods fright the ignorant: 1. This is the very method of thoſe Meditations by which every one that is brought home to God
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170278:21"/>is converted; For the firſt thing in converſion is our being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſome Truths, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction raiſeth affections, for if the truths of God end in convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and go no further, nay, if they end in affections only, and never come to reſolutions of ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning evil and doing good, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can never be perfected, as for example, One is convinced that he is a miſerable undone wretch by reaſon of originall and actuall abomination, Upon this conviction fear and ſorrow are raiſed, yet if theſe do not work in us a firm reſolution of leaving thoſe ſinnes, we are yet in our ſinnes and unconverted. 3. There are ſeverall things for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Meditation, as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. FOR being convinced of and affected with the preſence of God, it may thus be wrought.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to conſider that God is preſent every where, as truly, really, and eſſentially as he is in heaven; For God did not create heaven to confine him but to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his preſence, for <hi>the Heaven of Heavens are not able to contain him,</hi> for God is neither included by, nor excluded from any place, and though <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, <hi>Surely the Lord was in this place, and I knew it not,</hi> Gen. 28.16. yet we muſt not imagine that <hi>Jacob</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that truth, but did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170278:22"/>conſider it; but <hi>David</hi> in the 139. <hi>Pſalm</hi> is clear in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and clearing up the omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. 2. We muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God doth more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly obſerve his people, while they are performing of heavenly duties, whether it be, while they are ſpeaking unto him, or he ſpeaking unto them, he doth then more eſpecially obſerve the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and frame of their hearts, as when we are in any company we do more eſpecially look upon and obſerve thoſe to whom we ſpeak, or who ſpeak to us; yet this is to be underſtood not as if God did obſerve us more at one time then another, in reſpect of Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it ſelf; but thus, that God is much more offended with us, if our carriage and frame of heart be more irreverent, and unholy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170278:23"/>in the time of prayer and Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then at ſuch times as we are in the works of our particular calling.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may conſider with our ſelves that Chriſt doth actually behold us, eſpecially in theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of holineſſe, for it is not the diſtance of place that doth hin-Chriſts knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act obſerving of us. Little did <hi>Nathanael</hi> think that Chriſt ſaw him under the Fig-tree, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanael</hi> did not ſee Chriſt, nor was he corporally preſent then, yet Chriſt behold <hi>Nathanael</hi> when he praied, ſo Chriſt beheld <hi>Steven</hi> before the heavens were opened, and the opening of the heavens was not that thereby Chriſt might be enabled the better to behold <hi>Steven,</hi> but that <hi>Steven</hi> might thereby be the better enabled to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170278:23"/>ſee that Chriſt looked on him; without all controverſie God knows and obſerves with what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, faith, love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we pray, for elſe our praiers would be in vain, and our faith alſo vain, for how could he give us according to our faith if he knew not how much our faith were? If the inward frame of our hearts were not obſerved by him, then an hypocrite that hath better expreſſions ſhould get more by his prayers, then a true <hi>Nathanael</hi> that hath a better heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Suppoſe that thou hadſt lived in Chriſts time, or ſuppoſe that Chriſt were now in <hi>England,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with what joy, reverence, and confidence thou wouldeſt go to him for the pardon of thy ſins, or for any other mercy thou ſtoodſt in need of; Thou maiſt go
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170278:24"/>ſo to him now, his diſtance from thee in reſpect of corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence doth not make him leſſe able to know thy wants, or hear thy praiers, nor his being now glorified makes him leſſe willing to grant them then if he were bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſent in the room with thee in the form of a Servant, as he was once at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> the glory of Chriſt doth not hinder his love and goodneſſe, for Chtiſt is the expreſſe image of his Father, and God Attributes do not hinder one another; The Majeſty of God doth not ſet bounds unto his goodneſſe, and make that finite, nor doth his goodneſſe make his Majeſty leſſe glorious, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes his Majeſty more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and his Majeſty makes his goodneſſe more wonderfull; So neither doth the exaltation of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170278:24"/>Chriſt cauſe him to abate any thing of his goodneſſe unto his people, but if any way his love be altered, it is by being made more then it was, and when Chriſt was upon earth, you muſt have come to him by faith, or you could obtain no mercy from him, and by faith though he be in heaven you may obtain any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy now: You may conſider any one or two or more of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, until your heart be ſo convinced of and affected with the preſence of God, that you may thereby be the better fitted for the carrying on the duty of Meditation more effectually.</p>

               <p>THE next Preparatory conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is Praier, and it is to be performed in theſe words, or to like purpoſe: Lord, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in this duty of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not to be an hour ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred from worldly employments, for that were to be idle an hour, and to encreaſe my ſinnes not my graces, but my buſineſſe at this time is to be ſo convinced and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with thoſe ſpirituall Truths revealed in thy Word, that I may fully reſolve by thy ſtrength and power to reform my life, becauſe I can neither underſtand the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170278:25"/>things that belong to my peace, nor underſtanding them, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the certainty and truth of them; Nay Lord, though my underſtanding be enlightened, yet without thee mine affections can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enflamed; I can neither know, reſolve, nor perrform what is good without thee, for from thee comes both the will and the deed, of thy good pleaſure, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee Lord that thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt give me thy grace to make conſcience of performing this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with my whole ſtrength, and not careleſly and perfunctorily; And Lord do thou enlighten me with and convince me of thy Truths, and ſo affect my heart with the love of holineſſe and hatred of ſinne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I may thereby be enabled fully, firmly (notwithſtanding all the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170278:26"/>oppoſition that the fleſh, world, or devil can make) to run the waies of thy Commandements with joy and with ſpeed, and when thou haſt wrought in me the will ſo to do, give me alſo the deed, and that I may not truſt to the ſtrength of my reſolutions, but to the continuall gracious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of thy Spirit for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of thoſe things that through thee I ſhall reſolve to do: Holy and bleſſed God, Chriſt hath ſent me, wiſhing me to come to thee in his Name for any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies I ſtand in need of; grant theſe things which I have begged for the Lord Jeſus ſake, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>This or a prayer to the like purpoſe thou art to put up unto God, but it is to be done with thy whole heart, for thou muſt know that it is by the ſtrength
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170278:26"/>which thou ſhalt get from God by prayer, whereby thou ſhalt be enabled to perform this or any other duty profitably, for it is he that teacheth us to profit, he that begins a holy duty without God, will end it without God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. It is a dangerous thing to think that we can by our natural parts, learning, or by the ſtrength of grace already received, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods further aſſiſtance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any thing that can pleaſe God or edifie our own ſonls; For though our Mountain be made ſtrong, yet if he ſhall hide his face there will be trouble. We may with much more ſenſe ſay, Now the Sunne ſhines ſo bright, and the air is ſo clear, that now we can do well enough for a while, though the Sunne be ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed; then to ſay, though our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170278:27"/>hearts be never ſo much inflamed with the love of God, Now we are ſo filled and inflamed by his love, we ſhall do well enough by our own ſtrength, for the preſent we need not Gods further aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; Give us but fewell, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to meditate of, and we ſhall be able to continue and encreaſe our flames: Do not account it a burthen but a mercy and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that God hath neceſſitated and commanded thee alwaies to draw ſtrength from him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THey muſt be plain Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, not intricate and abſtruſe: For the main end of Meditation being the affecting of our heart, and reforming of our lives, and not informing of our underſtandings, our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be ſo plain, that they may be without difficulty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It muſt be certain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not controverſal and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for the end of Meditation is not properly to encreaſe our knowledge but to improve our knowledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Much leſſe ſhould our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations be curious and nice
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170278:28"/>ſpeculations, or if we chooſe any Book, by reading whereof to help our Meditation, we muſt not chooſe ſuch as are filled with flouriſhes and Rhetorick, for let a truth be dreſt never ſo curiouſly, the wit and eloquence wherewith the truth is cloathed, leaves the truth before it comes to the heart; as ſome meats that are made in curious works are ſpoiled of all thoſe curioſities before they come to the ſtomack; and the Bee lights not upon the Roſe which hath the freſheſt colour, and the ſweeteſt ſmell, but upon the thyme that is an Herb of little Beauty; Beſides Eloquence to them that meditate is much like pictures in Books to Children, they neglect their leſſon to look on their pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, they will be looking on the pictures while they ſhould be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170278:28"/>getting their leſſon; ſo the fancy will be playing with the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, when the heart ſhould be feeding on and affected with the truths we reade. The leſſe time the truth ſtaies in the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the better; for the work of the Underſtanding in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not to retain, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the Truths to the heart; As Phyſicians uſe when they are to give medicines to cure any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe in the bladder, they give ſuch as may ſooneſt come to the part affected, for if they ſtay by the way they loſe their vertue, before they come to the part which they ſhould cure; So if the Underſtanding ſhall ſtay dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying with the Eloquence or ſearching out the meaning or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the truth it conſiders any long while, the heart will lie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170278:29"/>cold and unaffected all that while: It is ſomewhat like that Story con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Muſitians that were to play before the Emperour of the Turks, who were ſo long tuning their Inſtruments which they ſhould have done before, that he would not ſtay to hear their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; Therefore let the Truths you conſider of to raiſe affections be plain, certain, nouriſhing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Rule is, that in caſe any doubt ariſeth upon a plain known Truth (for Satan will be ſubject to caſt in doubts againſt the moſt evident Truths) then do as the Arch-angel did with Satan, you may enter the liſts with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and it may be when you have a little conſidered and diſputed the matter, the miſt may vaniſh, and the Sun ſhine clear, and Satan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſiſted will preſently fly:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170278:29"/>but if Satan ſhall ſtill wrangle, and your blaſphemous doubts ſhall not be removed, then diſpute no more, but ſay as the Arch-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel did, the Lord rebuke thee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: As a woman that is attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be raviſhed will ſtrive and ſtruggle a while, and if ſhe findes that ſhe can quickly get looſe, ſhe flies, but otherwiſe ſhe cries out for help; The Arch-angel firſt diſputed, but when that would not ſpeedily prevail, appealed unto God; To this purpoſe it is good to be exceedingly well grounded in Truths from the Word of God, for that is the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that by which our Saviour ſilenced Satan in all his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 'Tis a dangerous thing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with Satan by humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we muſt <hi>put on the Armour of God,</hi> if we will be able to ſtand
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170278:30"/>in the evil day of temptation, and when all is done to ſtand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth Rule is, that we ſhould not over-multiply our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, but as ſoon as by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of the Truths of God we finde our hearts ſtrongly affected, then we are to paſſe over that part: but this Caution muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that we muſt not as ſoon as we finde our heart never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affected, leave off our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; The Bee will not go from the flower as long as any honey is eaſily drawn out of it: and indeed it is a temptation which the people of God ought to take notice of; That Satan is ſubject to make one paſſe over duties before we have drawn half the ſtrength of them, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, When we are confeſſing of our ſinnes, as ſoon as ever our
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170278:30"/>hearts begin in the leaſt meaſure to be humbled, he fils them with joy, ſuch joy may generally be ſuſpected to be from Satan or our own naughty hearts, not from God: Corn when it ſprings up too faſt, and grows rank, hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen cut it down, a corraſive that is laid on to eat dead fleſh muſt not be taken off as ſoon as it begins to ſmart, the Wheat in the ſtony ground did ſooneſt ſpring up; We ſhould let our conſiderations take deep root, and not paſſe over to affections and reſolutions as ſoon as ever they take hold of our heart, but it is alwaies to be remembred, that in caſe our affections be very much inflamed, as ſoon as ever we begin our conſiderations we are to yeeld to the Inſpirations of God, and to follow the leading of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170278:31"/>the Spirit; for this method that is ſet down, is not to binde up and limit the extraordinary work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God; but if our hearts be only a little moved, we muſt do as I have ſaid, not leave blowing the fire as ſoone as ever it begins a little to be kindled, for green wood (for ſuch are we in ſpirituall matters) will ſuddenly go out unleſſe it be very well kindled.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170278:31"/>the reforming of our lives; Our Affections are various according to the Subject we meditate of; Sometimes we admire Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his Majeſty, his Wiſedom, Sometimes we admire and wonder at our own folly and madneſſe, that we ſhould live ſo contrary to our own principles, that thoſe Truths that God revealed unto us on purpoſe that we might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to our eternall wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, we ſhould lay by as things forgotten and uſeleſſe; as if one that had a receit to cure the ſtone, and were convinced of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and efficacy of it, yet ſhould make no other uſe of it but to reade it over and lay it by; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the affection is deſpiſing the world, and abhorring our ſelves in duſt and aſhes, ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſometimes joy, love, fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> I.</p>
               <p>LEt your Reſolutions be firm and ſtrong, not ſlieghty, let not them be velleities or wiſhes, but reſolved pur poſes or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; Do not ſay with thy ſelfe, Well, I ſee very well that the wrath of God comes upon the <hi>Children of diſobedience,</hi> and I muſt to hell, or leave my taking
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170278:32"/>of the Name of God in vain; I do not do well to ſwear, and I could wiſh I could leave it; but ſay thus with thy ſelf, I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the bleſſing of God what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever comes of it; to leave my ſwearing; There is no dallying with God, nor giving a faint de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall to ſin; I have heard of one who hearing the ſin of Swearing ſpoke much againſt by ſome in whoſe company he was, obſerved their diſcourſe, and ſaid, Well, by the bleſſing of God I will never ſwear more, and though he was a common Swearer before, he was never ſince heard to ſwear one Oath to this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let thy reſolutions be for the time preſent, not for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Do not ſay, Well, I do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to leave my drinking, but for the preſent I am engaged in ſuch a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170278:33"/>meeting, and for that time I will do as I have done, but after that I will think of it, and take ſome order for mending of it; this is but one of Satans wiles whereby he coſeneth thee of thy whole life by daies, which he could not do by years; If Satan ſhould ſay unto thee, Thou ſhalt never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, never leave thy drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it may be it would ſtartle thee, and he would be in danger of getting nothing of thee by ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much: but he tempting thee only to let it alone this Week, and afterwards for a week longer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he obtains the ſame thing at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times which he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third Rule, Let thy reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions be not only againſt thy ſin but againſt the means, occaſions, and temptations to it; for it is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170278:33"/>better to diſcern Satan, if it may be, then to put a Sword in his hand, and ſay, thou canſt well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough defend thy ſelf againſt him: This is <hi>Solomons</hi> advice, He doth not ſay to him that would fly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, You may talk with a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, but <hi>Be not inticed by her words to uncleanneſſe,</hi> he will not give thee leave to go into her houſe, or ſo much as by her door, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.8. So when he diſſwadeth the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard from drunkenneſſe, he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him not ſo much as to look upon the Wine; For as the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a harlot, ſo the colour of wine will enflame our deſires after it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31. after this manner did <hi>Job</hi> reſolve, <hi>I have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with mine eyes that I will not look on a woman,</hi> and he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not only againſt the ſin it ſelf but againſt the beginnings and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170278:34"/>temptations to the ſin, <hi>Job</hi> 31.1. and God forbidding the <hi>Nazarites</hi> wine, forbad them to eat grapes, leſt by that they ſhould be enticed to drink wine. Now that I may preſſe this Rule, I ſhall anſwer an Objection which generally wicked men are ſubject to make, as thus, When we perſwade a Drunkard that he would leave his drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he would for two or three Moneths reſolve not to go into Tavern or Ale-houſe, he cries out of preciſeneſs, and ſaith, What, do you count it a ſinne to drink in a Tavern or Ale-houſe? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when our hearts are affected with the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and wrought up to a hatred of it, we do as when we exceedingly hate any man, we avoid all thoſe places where we are likely to meet
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170278:34"/>him; I may bid ſuch an one ask God why he forbids the adulterer to walk by the doors of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; May he not ſay, Why, ſhe lives in ſuch a ſtreet, and as honeſt and godly men walk that way as in any other place in the City?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider that <hi>Licitis perimus omnes</hi> is a good ſaying, we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally periſh by lawfull things, for in things that are unlawfull we are generally more watchfull.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe things that may be lawful to others may not be ſo to thee; Meats that are moſt nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing to men in health, are poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to one in a Feaver.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Know this, that though to be tempted be not a ſinne, yet when we have found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that going to a Tavern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath been a ſnare and temptation that hath generally prevailed
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170278:35"/>over us, then to be tempted with ſuch a temptation is a ſin though one yeelds not, becauſe by going into temptation which we need not, we ſinne; for if one ſhall ſay I reſolve that though I do ſpeak with the harlot, I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, though thou doſt ſo, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteſt all her enticements, thou ſinneſt notwithſtanding, for thou plainly breakeſt the Command, <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.8.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſe that it were lawfull for thee to drink wine in a Tavern that haſt been ſo often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by it, yet one effect of true repentance is an holy revenge, by debarring our ſelves thoſe things which are lawfull, taking Gods part againſt our ſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 11.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider that if thy hatred of ſinne and love of God be not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170278:35"/>ſtrong enough to ſtop thee from the beginnings, and keep thee from the occaſions of ſinne, how canſt thou expect that it ſhould keep thee from committing the ſinne it ſelf, when it hath got ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over thee. He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtop himſelf at firſt, will much leſſe (when he hath rolled down a ſteep hill half way) be able to ſtop himſelf, for then he fals with more violence, and the ſame ſtrength to hold will not ſerve then which would at firſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall ſtill continue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to reſolve not only againſt the ſinne, but againſt the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I muſt give you one caution, <hi>viz.</hi> that though you finde your heart never ſo much reſolving againſt and abhorring of any ſinne, yet take heed that you build not upon the ſtrength of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170278:36"/>reſolutions, but beg of God that he would enable you by his ſtrength, and that as he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you the will, ſo he would give you the deed alſo. It was well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by one, as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>In effect it is true that we doe underſtand many things by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience which we ſhould not underſtand by knowledge, as this, I having oftentimes determined to do many things, the one more pious, holy, and Chriſtian then another, and having ſeen for the moſt part the iſſue and effect to be quite contrary to what I determined; and on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, obſerving that other pious and Chriſtian things were done by me, without my prae-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or forecaſt; I ſtood a it were confounded in my ſelf, not underſtanding in what this ſecret
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170278:36"/>did conſiſt; I did not wonder that in things which I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a man, the contrary ſhould come to paſſe of that which I would; but I did wonder that in the things which I determined as a Chriſtian, the ſame ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall me; And finding my ſelf in this confuſion, it came to paſſe that I read that Reſolution of Saint <hi>Peter, Though I ſhould die with thee yet will I not deny thee;</hi> and conſidering that though the Reſolution was pious, holy, and Chriſtian, the contrary of that which he reſolved befell him; I underſtand that my determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had not their iſſue and effect according to my deſire, becauſe I did not well conſider mine own utter diſability to perform any holy and good work; So that I underſtood by experience, that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170278:37"/>although God puniſhed my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſſe in not ſuffering that to come to paſſe which I intended; yet on the other ſide he ſatisfied my general deſire of doing good, by ſuffering that to come to paſſe which I did not procure, nor hope, nor pretend unto; Whence I have gathered, that the will of God is, that I ſhould depend on him in ſuch manner, that I ſhould determine or propound nothing without holding him before mine eyes, ſhewing unto him my good will, and referring unto him the iſſue and ſucceſſe of my deſires and endeavours.</q>

               </head>
               <p>NOw becauſe Vows do very frequently, eſpecially in young beginners follow upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and becauſe that very many pious and religious perſons have been enſnared by raſh Vows, and after Vows it is not fit to make enquiry, therefore I ſhall ſet down ſome Cautions of, and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions fot Vows.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As we have ſaid concerning Reſolutious, let your Vows be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the occaſions of ſinne then againſt ſin it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the ſubject of your Vows are of things indifferent in themſelves,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take heed of making any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170278:38"/>vow, for the reaſon why you make any vows againſt any indifferent thing, as in drinking wine, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> It is becauſe then it was a ſnare unto you, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, it may ceaſe to be a ſnare unto you, nay it may be a very great ſnare, and occaſion ſickneſſe or death, not to drink it, as in ſome caſes hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let all Vows concerning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things be conditionall, and let theſe two conſtantly be two of the conditions. 1. That you will abſtain from ſuch a thing, or do ſuch a thing, unleſſe you ſhall be otherwiſe adviſed by ſome godly Miniſter or private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. I knew a Religious woman that had vowed to reade many Chapters every day; when ſhe was unmarried ſhe made this vow,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170278:38"/>but afterwards in the time of her lying in, and other weakneſſes, the Chapters were ſo many, that ſhe did much endanger the loſſe of her ſight, and the neglect of all other duties, when her poverty and family grew great; Now had ſhe added this Caution to her Vow, ſhe might have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of that ſnare, and though it be true that in many caſes a Vow may be diſpenſed withall, when we cannot keep it without ſinne, as in this caſe, one hath vowed a weekly ſecret Faſt, ones health, or childe with which one goes will certainly be deſtroyed by it, yet if it be but an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, though a very great one, it will not releaſe one from ones vow; Now the reaſon why I adde that condition (unleſſe ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or for want thereof ſome
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170278:39"/>other godly Chriſtian ſhall other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe adviſe) is becauſe the ſeveral caſes that may happen are ſo vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that it is impoſſible to ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them all, or think of them all, and very difficult to judge of them all, when we make the Vow; And moreover if we ſhould leave it to our ſelves, we ſhould be too par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, for as when our conſciences are much touched for our ſinnes, we are ſubject to be too violent in our ſpiritual revenges, ſo in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time when that pang is over, we are ſubject to be too indulgent to our ſelves, therefore it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſay thus, Lord, I do vow unto thee, that I will keep every week a day of humiliation, or that I will not drink any wine this three moneths next followiog, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſome ſuch occaſion ſhall be, that if it had then been, or then
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170278:39"/>thought of when I made my vow, that ſuch or ſuch, or ſome other godly Miniſter would (had I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with him then) wiſht me not to have made that Vow; then to ſay, I will do this or that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſome ſuch occaſion be, that were the Vow to be made again, I would not make it. 2. Adde this Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> If I remember it, I will not drink wine this moneth, the reaſon is, becauſe if you drink wine, though you did not think of it, you ſinne if your vow be abſolute, but if it be with that condition it is not a ſinne, and yet by adding that condition we give our ſelves no liberty, ſince it is not in our power to forget it. The next Caution concerning Vows in indifferent things is this, adde a penalty upon the breach of your Vow, which penalty is not added
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170278:40"/>by way of hope of Satisfaction, that's groſſe ignorance and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but it muſt run thus, I will ſpend half an hour a day in praier for the Church to the end of this moneth, or elſe give ſo much to the poor, and in ſuch a caſe if we do either we ſin not: the reaſon why we ſhould adde a penalty it, becauſe ſome inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences may be ſo great, that it would bring ſome very great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon us, and then we have liberty to take the other part of the Vow, <hi>viz.</hi> to give ſo much to the poor; And now this penalty muſt 1. Not be too light and trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but it muſt be of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that it may be a tye upon us, and yet not of ſo great weight as if it ſhould happen, it might prove ſome great inconvenience to us; For a rich man to ſay he

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170278:41"/>of ſin, rather againſt ſpeaking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grily then being angry, for though inward acts of ſinne are worſe, yet they are not ſo much in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The next Rule is, If your Vows are concerning doing holy duties, it is better to vow to ſpend ſo much time in reading holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or ſuch like, then to vow to reade ſo many Chapters, for thou wilt be tempted to reade them over too faſt, that thou maiſt have ended, whereas if it be, ſo much time that thou haſt reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſpend, thou wilt not be ſo ſubject to this temptation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Rules for the concluding of Meditation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THou art earneſtly to beg of God ſtrength to perform whatever thou haſt reſolved to do in his ſervice; This muſt be done fervently, though briefly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, proceeding from an earneſt deſire to do what thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and reſolved, and alſo from an humble ſenſe of thine inability to perform it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond duty is thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, if thou ſhalt perceive any heavenly warmth of love or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hatred of ſin, or any other ſpiritual effect wrought in thy heart, thou art to give God the glory, and not to rejoyce in thy
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170278:42"/>ſelf, but in the Lord, but thou art to rejoyce with trembling, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if thou art puft up, though thou haſt the will to do good wrought in thee, yet if thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokeſt him, he can ſtop it, that thou ſhalt never be able to do what thou reſolveſt to do.</p>
               <p>The firſt is an humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of our failings in the performing of this duty; For if we were not geeen wood, that love which is now but a ſpark would have been a flame; God is not wanting unto us, but we are wanting to our ſelves and him; After theſe are performed there remaineth three duties more.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are to remember what Vows and promiſes we have made, and it is very uſeful to write down all thy Vows (as thou makeſt them) in a Book, becauſe that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170278:42"/>we ſhall elſe be ſubject to forget the Vow, or the time, or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon which we made it; And it is good to have a Book to keep a Regiſter of things in it (beſides a Diary which I have ſpoken of, and given Rules for, in a Manuall, entituled, <hi>A Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to Chriſtian Perfection.</hi> 1. Let one head be (for which you are to leave ſome leaves) for Vows, under which you muſt write all your Vows or Reſolutions, as you make them, or ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes for Chriſtians, and ſuch like. The ſecond muſt be for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, eminent deliverances, and alſo anſwers of Praiers; Theſe are to be ſet down with all perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent circumſtances that may any way encreaſe the mercy. The third head ſhould be for groſſer failings, which were good to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170278:43"/>writ down, not in letters at length that every one may reade them, but in characters known only to our ſelves; There are other things which becauſe I do not now ſpeak purpoſely of that buſineſſe I omit.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing after Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ended, is, to remember what paſſages in our Meditation did moſt affect us, and as it were to lay them up in our thoughts, that frequently we may in the reſt of the day think of them; As when we walk in a garden we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not our ſelves with enjoying the fragrancy of the flowers while we are there, but if we may have leave we often gather a Noſegay to ſmell of the reſt of the day. In this buſineſſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation do thou likewiſe.</p>
               <p>The third duty after Meditation
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170278:43"/>is by degrees warily and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to go out of the preſence of God to worldly emploiments; Do not go from the preſence of God as a bird out of the ſnare, with joy and with ſpeed; And thou muſt go alſo watchfully and warily from ſuch emploiments, as one that carries ſome precious liquor in a ſhallow, broad, brittle diſh, he looks to his way, to the diſh and liquor that is in it, leſt by holding of it awry by fals or ſtumblings, he ſhould ſpill the one or break the other; So muſt thou be watchfull over thy waies, elſe the grace that God hath powred into thy heart in this duty will be ſpilt. To ruſh into holy duties or out of them, argues too great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of the things of God.</p>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170278:47"/>is heavier then I can bear, and yet notwithſtanding I go from the preſence of God too, and that more and more. My tears dry up in mine eyes, and my love goes out of my heart as ſoon as kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; When the Candle of the Lord ſhined upon my Tabernacle in my firſt converſion, when the fire of thy love was kindled in my heart, I have had ſome diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of devotion, that I was not able to bear the raviſhment that the remembrance and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them brought to my ſoul, now almoſt as full of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as then of joy: after thoſe times, as thoſe after the Floud, My joys and the acts and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my grace grew very ſhort-lived in compariſon of what they were before; Then they were <hi>Methuſalems</hi> for age, and <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170278:48"/>who it is that ſpeaks, or if open them, they being preſently heavy with death, fall down again, and he dies; So is it with my poor ſoul ſometimes, I can hear my Saviour as it were ſaying unto me (for ſometimes methinks I ſee him about my ſick ſoul,) Ah poor Soul how doſt thou do? Is my <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> yet living? But alas, Lord, thou knoweſt I have ſcarce ſtrength or life to lift up mine eye to thee, Lord, Can theſe bones live?

               <p>Lord, There is no peace until thou haſt all our love; while our heart is divided between the world and thee, we can have no quiet, natural Conſcience draws
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170278:96"/>one way, and natural corruptions another way; It is our ignorance that makes us think that there is not enough in thee to ſatisfie all our deſires, and to ſupply our want, which makes us joyn the creature with thee; When Lord, when ſhall all my thoughts be of thee? I am weary of being thus divided; Lord, if I can diſpoſe of my ſelf, I give my ſelf wholly to thee; O refuſe not that gift which thou haſt ſo often deſired, thou haſt ſaid, give me thy hearr, Lord mine heart longs whileſt thou haſt it; If thou ſaiſt that I do not give my ſelf freely and wholly enough, alas, nor never ſhall until thou take my heart, and diſcovereſt the ſecrets of thy love unto me, when thou doſt that I ſhall runne after thee; Lord, here's my poor ſoul, it lies at thy ſeet, groveling and

            <p n="1">1. LET us ſeriouſly conſider O my Soul, That if an Angel, or God himſelf from Heaven had ſpoken theſe words in our hearing, as once Chriſt did to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170278:104"/>going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> ſurely I think they would have very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected us: Is the Word of God leſſe his Word becauſe it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? I reade that the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. ſpeaking of a voice that he himſelf heard from Heaven, ſaith, that he <hi>had a more ſure word of Prophecy,</hi> that is, as I conceive, that he was no leſſe ſure that the words of the Prophets were the very words of God, then thoſe that he heard with his ears; Then let us not be leſſe affected with theſe words then if we our ſelves had heard God himſelf ſpeak them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor let us think that they leſſe concern us, then if we had earneſtly begged of God to tell us what he would have us to be and do; and as an Anſwer of our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we had heard him ſpeak to us
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170278:104"/>from heaven in particular, <hi>To this man will I look that is of a poor and contrite ſpirit, and trembleth at my Word:</hi> For doubtleſſe God hath not cauſed his Word to be written in vain, at a venture, for whomſoever ſhould reade it, but knew not who they were ſhould reade it, but he knew every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon, to whoſe hand his Word ſhould come, and knew his Word ſhould come to my hands, and I ſhould reade theſe very words, and therefore cauſed them to be written in particular for my ſake, though not excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Chriſt died for all his people, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he loved me and gave himſelf for me,</hi> and Chriſt did think particularly of <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo of every one elſe for whom he died and gave himſelf up as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and ranſome, particularly
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170278:105"/>thinking on and intending every one that ſhould be ſaved by his death: If a Miniſter ſhould go to one that is given to Swearing, and tell him of the hainouſneſſe of that ſin, and lay it home to his conſcience in private, it generally doth affect him more then to hear the ſame ſinne reproved in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, yet he ſhould as particularly apply it then, though he had not in this reſpect ſo much reaſon to apply it, as I have to apply theſe words to mine own ſoul; For the Miniſter doth not nor can actually and particularly intend every one that is guilty of the ſinnes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves (for he knows not every particular perſon that is guilty of the ſinne he reproves) as God doth every one that reades his word; Therefore let us take this and apply it to our ſelves, as if
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170278:105"/>God had ſent theſe words written with his own hand to me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: When it is ſaid that the Scripture is written for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 15.4. I conceive the meaning is not only by way of ſufficiency, but by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, efficacy, and decree, in reſpect of his people, that is, not only that there is a ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Scripture to inſtruct us, but that God did intend and decree that this place of Scripture ſhould inſtruct every particular one of his people that is inſtructed by it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And indeed what is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that I now reade theſe words, and do now intend to meditate on them? Is it not, or certainly it ought to be, that I ſhould try whether I am ſuch, and whether I have ſuch an heart and ſpirit as
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170278:106"/>theſe words ſignifie, and if I am not ſo much as I ought to be, that I ſhould humble my ſelf, and be as truly ſenſible and as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and much more, then I am with thoſe bodily infirmities that lies upon me; and if ſo be there were a receit given me, which I had a long time ſought for, and endeavoured to get, being aſſured that if I had it, it would cure me; Surely I ſhould not only reade it, becauſe I might be able to tell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what would cure ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, or to enable my ſelf to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of that matter, but I ſhould read it with abundance of joy, and unqueſtionable reſolution to take it: Alas Lord, why do I not reade thy Word ſo alſo, where the unqueſtionable remedies of all ſpirituall diſeaſes are ſet down? Surely it is my ſeaſeleſneſſe of the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170278:106"/>miſchiefs of theſe ſpiritual diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that makes me ſo little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with grief for them, and with joy that I have found out the remedies for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Bleſſed God, it is no more in my power to know thee by the ſtrength of mine own abilities, if thou doſt not menifeſt thy ſelf and thy truths unto me, then it is for me to ſee the Sunne without the Sunne, therefore Lord do thou take off the Veil that is upon my heart and underſtanding, and that which is upon thy Truths. I reade in thy word that my bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did rejoyce in ſpirit, and give thee thanks, becauſe thou didſt hide thy Truths from thoſe that were wiſe and prudent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal them unto babes; O that I were of the number of thoſe babes to whom thou wouldeſt reveal
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170278:107"/>thy Truths: Lord, give me a powerfull, ſpirituall, experimental knowledge of the Truths that are included in theſe words.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And holy and bleſſed Father, If thou wilt be pleaſed to let me know thy minde in thy Word, though thy commands ſhould be never ſo croſſe to my corruptions, (my baſe corruptions, which have hindred me from a world of joys, grace, and communion with thee, which if it had not been for them I might had long ago) I will do it by the power of thy might; Lordforbid that I ſhould be ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as to enquire of thee the Lord (which I do or ſhould do as often as I reade the Scripture;) as we reade the Jews did deſire the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to enquire of thee for them, though they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved before-hand what to do;
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170278:107"/>Yet they ſaid, <hi>they would do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou ſhouldeſt command, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were good or evil:</hi> Oh that I had at leaſt a heart to reſolve to ſerve thee; If I muſt want, let me want riches, health, liberty, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then grace; Rather let me want ſtrength then want a will to ſerve thee; I had as good ſinne unwillingly as to do what thou commandeſt unwillingly; Lord, give me truth in the inward parts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thoſe things that lie plain in theſe words is, that thoſe that are of a poor and contrite ſpirit, that tremble at the Word of God, are highly eſteemed of him; So that poverty of ſpirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of ſpirit, and trembling at the Word of God, are the three things that are here ſo highly commended and prized by God.</p>
            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:170278:108"/>
            <p n="7">7. But now let us ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether we are thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Am I poor in ſpirit? Thoſe that are ſo have low thoughts of themſelves, and are not troubled that others have low thoughts of them too; They like reproofs better then praiſes; They do not murmure under afflictions, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder they are no more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; Is it thus with us?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Lord, If there be any thing of poverty of ſpirit in me, if I take reproofs well, or afflictions in any meaſure patiently, certain it is, it is not at all from my ſelf: I was born with as proud a heart as any, and certain I am that I did not change mine own heart; Thou takeſt away the ſtony heart we do not give thee it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But alas Lord, I am far from being poor in ſpirit in any meaſure
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170278:108"/>according to that which thou in thy Word requireſt. My paſſion and the boylings of my heart, my loving to be called <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and to be eſteemed by others, and many other diſtempers and corruptions of that nature, which I have daily to ſtruggle withal, evidently prove the pride of my heart, nay, and the afflictions that thou laieſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me plainly ſhow what the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is that thou intendeſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to cure, by the Medicine ofttimes one may know what the diſeaſe is; and Lord it is in vain (if there were no other end in it then to manifeſt my diſtempers to thee) for me to confeſſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pride of mine heart, the ſtrange windings, turnings, depths, and ſtrange and new Monſters of pride and hypocriſie; that I might daily diſcover in my ſelf;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170278:109"/>Alas Lord thou knoweſt theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, and ſince thou doſt ſo what cauſe have I to wonder that thou ſhouldſt ſhine upon ſuch a dunghill as I am! But Lord, thou that only canſt cure me of this pride and hypocriſie of heart, for my praiers cannot, nay, though I conſider and am convinced of the deſperate wickedneſſe of mine own heart, the vileneſſe of my nature, the abominations of my life, yet theſe cannot work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, as a Plaiſter though it be never ſo excellent, laid on the wounds of a dead man, it draws not, it heals not, ſo are all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations and convictions to a dead heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But alas, what is there in me whereof I ſhould in any meaſure pride my ſelf? For others to have good thoughts of me is no very
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170278:109"/>ſtrange thing, for ſo they had of the Scribes and Phariſees; but for one that knows the baſeneſſe of his own heart, the carnal grounds, manner, and ends of his actions, and a thouſand other diſtempers and corruptions, for ſuch an one to have high thoughts of himſelf is, one would think, impoſſible, But that as to God nothing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that argues power; ſo to ſuch a heart as every one hath by nature nothing is impoſſible, that argues ſinne; and we have more cauſe to wonder that we have not committed the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, then that we have done the evils that we have; For certainly had God but given us up to the ſtrength of our own corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, and to Satans ſubtlety and malice to improve them, we had committed that ſinne long agoe,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170278:110"/>and alas, what good doth the high eſteem of others do us? Are we ever a whit the more holy becauſe they think us ſo? Nay, hath it not proved a means to make us more ſinful? God hath abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his wrath againſt this ſin, by that vengeance which he hath poured out upon Satan for being guilty of it: How many ſevere threatnings are there in the Word of God againſt pride, and how many precious promiſes to thoſe that are humble; The Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the proud afar off, but to this man will he look that is of a poor and contrite ſpirit, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at his Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What are the things that cauſe thee to pride thy ſelf? Are they thy gifts either of edification or ſanctification? Conſider that 1. They are very mean, ſcarce any
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170278:110"/>of thy calling hath weaker gifts of edification, and no Saint under heaven hath weaket gifts of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. 2. Suppoſe thy gifts were great, O what a heavy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt there be for miſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch talents? What way canſt thou worſe miſpend them then by priding thy ſelf in them? Do men praiſe thee? Alas thou maiſt go to hell with their praiſes, for ſo did the Scribes and Phariſees: Do all men ſpeak well of thee? and doſt thou pride thy ſelf and rejoyce in that? Fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Woe unto you when all men ſpeak well of you, for ſo did their Fathers of the falſe Prophets.</hi> 3. Conſider how unkindely thou dealeſt with God, thou doſt as a woman that ſhould deck her ſelf with the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els that her husband had given
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170278:111"/>her, nay, that ſhe ſhould give away theſe Jewels to thoſe with whom ſhe plaied the harlot, the more to entice them, Is not this the act of an imperious whoriſh woman? as God himſelf doth phraſe it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.30. and do but reade that Chapter, and you ſhall ſee whether you have not abuſed all the bleſſings of God more then they did; They ſpent them in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to and in worſhiping of Idols, and can one make a baſer Idol in the world to fall down and worſhip it then ones ſelf?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us conſider what are the remedies of this ſin. 1. Conſider how much hell there is in thy heart, What a baſe and vile wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nature thou haſt; Conſider what the Scripture ſpeaks of men in their natural condition, and be ſure the Scripture which was
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170278:111"/>written by the Spirit of God, doth not uſe to do as thoſe vain men do, who when they praiſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe, care not whether their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are true or falſe, ſo they be high enough, and they rather ſtrive to ſpeak as much as they can, then as much as they ought; ſurely whatſoever the Scripture hath ſpoken is made good to the utmoſt by thoſe that are in hell, and would by every man on earth, did God withdraw his reſtraining, ſanctifying grace, and were thoſe ſparks of hellfire that is in every one by nature blown up to a flame, and heightned by thoſe ſufferings that are there inflicted. 2. Conſider how little good and how much corruption there is in our beſt actions, from what car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principles, upon what carnal grounds, and for what carnal ends
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170278:112"/>we perform our holy duties; ſurely there is more ſinne in our beſt actions then ever yet we have diſcovered in our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abominations: Do but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon thoſe ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations ſet down in the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our ſins, and it will be a great preſervative and remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt pride. Laſtly, Reſolve with thy ſelf never (unleſs the glory of God may thereby be advanced) to ſpeak or do any thing that may cauſe others to have high thoughts of thee, or at leaſt not to that end; Whatever good duties thou doſt, whether of prayer or alms; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſecretly as may be, <hi>Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth.</hi> Though thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to be humbled for thy ſins, becauſe they offend and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour God, and ſcandalize Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170278:112"/>yet let not this at all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, that thereby the eſteem that men have of thee is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated: To conclude, pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly as if thou wert to pray for thy life, for it is thy life that God would humble thee, deſire God to afflict thee, or uſe any means that he would ſanctifie to that end; and when thou haſt finiſht thy Meditation, conſider what paſſage hath moſt affected thee, and keep it in thy thoughts, that by often thinking of it thou maiſt be humbled and made to be of a poor and a contrite ſpirit, that God may delight in thee, and that thou maiſt delight in him. Now to the King eternal, the immortall, inviſible, and only wiſe God, be honour and glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Pray, deſire God that he would by his Spirit blow theſe coals of mercies, that he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame thy heart with love and joy and praiſe of him; alas otherwiſe the judgements of God will not affect us, nor the mercies of God enflame us; 'tis the Spirit that quickeneth, elſe mercies will not profit.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Conſider ſeriouſly how much God abhors ſinne, and how odious it is to him; this you may ſee both by what God hath ſaid and what God hath done to ſhew the abhorrence of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinners, it is ſaid that God loatheth them, and they lothe God, <hi>Zec.</hi> 11.8. and God by his Prophet crieth out, ſaying, O do
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170278:125"/>not this abominable thing which I hate; How often doth God profeſſe his hatred of ſinne? if one ſhould ſpit in a mans face, or lay toads or Serpents in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or whatſoever you could imagine, it could not be ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to him as ſinne is to God, he hates it more then we hate hell; how can we know any ones hatred of any thing but by his expreſſions and his actions, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you ſhould ſee one take ſome curious, coſtly, or rare diſh of meat which he loved above any meat in the world, and becauſe there was ſome ſmall crum of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other meat which he had an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy againſt, he ſhould fling all with violence and deteſtation away, were not this enough to ſatisfie you that he abhorred that meat, a crum whereof made him
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170278:126"/>abhor that which he ſo much lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? Suppoſe you ſhould ſee one take a Watch, whoſe wheels and all the reſt were cut out of intire Diamonds, and ſpying ſome little ſmall, and almoſt indiſcernable ſpider in it, ſhould fling it to the ground with ſo much violence that he ſhould break it all to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it would evidently argue how much he deteſted a ſpider: What excellent Creatures are Angels, and yet becauſe a ſinne though but of thought was found in them, how doth it caſt them like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into hell! Suppoſe further thou ſhouldſt ſee the meekeſt, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt man, and lovingſt Father in the world, taking his Son, and ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him with rod after rod, until that he wereall of gore bloud from head to foot, and though he cried out and begged of his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170278:126"/>Father to ſpare, yet he would not ſpare him, but ſcourged him to death: Would you not ſay that the Sonne had done ſomewhat that the Father did wonderfully abhor? Hath not God dealt thus with Chriſt? Did he not chaſtiſe him until he ſhed bloud from the Crown of the head to the ſole of the feet? Did not Chriſt die under his correcting hand? Did not Chriſt cry out again and again, <hi>Father if it be poſſible let this cup paſſe from me?</hi> And did he not love Chriſt more then any Father loved his Sonne, and all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was guilty of ſinne, though but as a Surety; theſe things are not inventions of wit or rhetorick, but reall truths; If the deſtroying of <hi>Sodom, Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha, Jeruſalem,</hi> Angels, and the moſt part of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170278:127"/>the whole world, ſave eight per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; If the Sufferings of Chriſt be not enough to ſatisfie thee of Gods hatred of ſinne, then thou maiſt go on to thy own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but know this <hi>that it will be bitterneſſe at the laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider what thou doſt when thou ſinneſt, every ſinner doth virtually put heaven and Chriſt, and God, and his favour and loving kindeneſſe, and all his promiſes in one ſcale, and that pleaſure, profit, or honour which ſinne promiſeth, with a wounded conſcience, the torments of hell, the wrath of God in the other ſcale, and doubtleſſe virtually a ſinner chooſech ſinne with all theſe miſchiefs, before the ſervice of God with all his mercies. It is as if a ſinner ſhould ſay, Rather then I will not ſatisfie my baſe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:170278:127"/>luſt; I will part with God, with Chriſt, with heaven and all, I will ſuffer his wrath, let God do his worſt I will have my will; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very obſtinate ſinner doth in his heart ſay thus, and though now thou little imagineſt it, yet at the day of judgement this will be made as manifeſt to thee as if it were writ with a beam of the Sunne; Things that now ſeem leſſe conſequent, ſhall then be made evident: A wicked wretch that ſees one of Gods people hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, naked, impriſoned, and doth not relieve him; he little thinks that is all one as if he had ſeen Chriſt ſo, and not reliev'd him; but at the day of judgement Chriſt will make it manifeſt unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider how often thou haſt ſinned againſt God, Every
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170278:128"/>unconverted man doth nothing elſe, his plowing is an abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>all his imaginations are only evil and that continually:</hi> Nay, though thou art one of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet <hi>David</hi> cries out, <hi>that his ſinnes are more in number then the hairs of his head,</hi> and doſt thou think thy ſinnes are fewer then <hi>Davids?</hi> How many years haſt thou lived? how many daies, hours, minutes? thy ſinnes are more; The Hour-glaſſe that runs hath not ſo many ſands in it as the ſinnes that thou committeſt in that hour; If thou doſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this conſider, that there is not one of thy thoughts, words, actions, but is polluted with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſins; If thou ſaiſt <hi>[Our Father]</hi> ſince thou doſt not ſpeak it with that reverence, attention, fervency, faith, love, joy, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

Fear not making thy ſinnes ſeem greater or more than they are.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider further for what trifling vanity, nay for what baſe things that thou wilt be aſhamed to own before men, thou haſt loſt God, loſt thine own ſoul, if thou returneſt not, and haſt brought on thy ſelf more miſeries than the tongue of man can expreſs, or the heart of man conceive: there is nothing that thou ſeeſt with thy eyes, or heareſt with thy ears, or feeleſt with thy hand, is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true than this. But alas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170278:129"/>thou haſt heard it ſo often, and God of his infinite goodneſs and patience hath not made thee yet to feel the ſtroak of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the miſery due to ſinne; thou wilt not believe him, though his threatnings be never ſo clearly ſet down and with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Conſider againſt what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mercies, what ſweet love, what bleſſed experience, holy inſpirations, what abundance of means, ſtrong reſolutions, precious promiſes, clear light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou haſt ſinn'd.</p>

                  <p>It is enough O my ſoul, and too too much, that we have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing our ſelves and provoking God thus long: that we have as it were with all our power pull'd down the vengeance of God upon us, and as it were kindling his wrath againſt us, but he hath not ſuffered his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe, nor ſuffered us to periſh though we would; bleſſed be his Name that we have not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Canſt thou not remember that thou wert by ſuch an one when he died, didſt thou not ſee how his countenance failed, his eye-ſtrings broke; how he grew weaker and weaker, at laſt grew ſpeechleſs; how he throtl'd in the throat, how his teeth grated, how he ſweated and ſtrugled for life, and at laſt gaſpt, and died: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that thus thou muſt do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, how ſoon the Lord only knowes; that thou art well now is nothing, that thou art young and ſtrong now is nothing, for how many are there that have been ſtrong, and well, and as young as thou, within a very few dayes after have been in their grave. That thou muſt die is certain,

Alas who knowes not all theſe things, and yet not one of a thouſand conſider and lay them to heart, and to know theſe truth and live unſuitably to them, doth but add to our folly and madneſs: <hi>O that they were wiſe,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>that they would conſider their latter end.</hi> Theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſiderations of our death, and preparation for it, is one of the chiefeſt points of wiſedom in the world.</p>

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170278:150"/>wrath and fury of God that he ſhall pour out upon the wicked: then they ſhall pay for every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they have received, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his deſpiſed goodneſs ſhall but increaſe the treaſures of his wrath: therefore O my ſoul, ſince theſe things are ſo, what are we to do? why do we not <hi>fear him that can caſt both body and ſoul into hell?</hi> The Prophet <hi>Habacuc,</hi> when he did but think but of ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall judgements that God had threatned, <hi>rottenneſs entred into his bones.</hi> If indeed the love of God did conſtrain us, ſo that we did from a principle of love make conſcience of ſinne, ſo that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver offend God, it were well; but ſince we plainly find that it is not ſtrong enough alone, let us not fear to call in and improve the conſideration of the torments of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170278:151"/>hell to deter us from ſin; the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is imperfect but not ſinfull; our great work we have to do in the world, next to the glory of God, is to avoid hell, and obtain heaven, and to reſiſt our now three great enemies the world, the fleſh and the devil, who endeavour day and night to drive us headlong into perdition. If any one in the world, much more if the devil ſhould appear to us, and offer us ſuch a ſum of money if we would give him our ſouls that we might be damn'd, we think we ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre him and his offer; but alas doth not every one that uſeth by extortion and violence either get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth or keepeth what is not his, do the ſame thing? his damnation it as certain and as infallible, though more ſecretly and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly contrived by Satan, as if
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170278:151"/>Satan ſhould viſibly appear to him and he make a contract with him: therefore O my ſoul let us take heed of the wiles of Satan, for he generally works by the world, and the fleſh to deceive us, therefore let us now reſolve by the bleſſing of God to look upon the world and the fleſh, to be as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and implacable enemies as Satan himſelf, let us not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pleaſe the world by vain diſcourſes, by omitting what God commands, or doing what he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids: Let us not be troubled but rather rejoyce; when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd and ſcorn'd for righteouſneſs ſake; For the time to come when I am to do any religious duty, I will not ſo much as conſider what men will judge or ſay of me, nor endeavour to make the world my Friend, ſince God himſelf
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170278:152"/>hath ſet enmity between us; and as for the fleſh I am ſure we are no debters unto that, we have paid it farre more then ever we owed it, therefore for the time to come I will rather abſtain from lawfull, then uſe unlawfull pleaſures, and I will take heed not only of thoſe pleaſures that are unlawfull in kind, but thoſe alſo that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull in degree: and that I may better avoid unlawfull pleaſures, I will ſometimes abſtain from thoſe that are lawfull; and having ſeriouſly conſidered, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of this, that I have not made conſcience enough in the matter of ſleep, I have not redeem'd the time from that, nor have enough conſidered the ſinfulneſs of it, but like the ſluggard that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>have turned upon my bed as a door upon the hinges,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170278:152"/>henceforth I ſhall endeavour to get as much time from ſleep, as the health and ſtrength of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will permit: and becauſe I am confident that if the damned were in their natures changed, and were to live again on earth, they would think it a bleſſed change, to change their howlings into ſinging of Pſalms, and their roarings into Prayers, nay if they were to live <hi>Methuſelahs</hi> age upon the rack: Therefore whenſoever I am at any time tempted to be weary of this labour of love that is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken in the hardeſt duties of religion, I will endeavour to ſhame my ſelf out of that temptation, by thinking thus with my ſelfe, that hell is ſo much worſe then we can ſuffer in this world, either in Gods ſervice or for Gods ſervice; that it were not only a deſperate
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170278:153"/>wickedneſs but madneſs, for the avoiding of the one to fall into the other. For the concluſion of this Meditation, obſerve the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Inſtances of former Meditations.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Conſider O my ſoul the wonderfull greatneſs and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibleneſs of thoſe joys. For 1. Conſider what great things God hath given to wicked men in this work, what vaſt dominions, power, wiſedom, learning, majeſty, and indeed as to the things of the world as much as their hearts can deſire; if God gives ſuch things to Doggs and Swine, what may we think are the dainties of that ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket which God feaſts his children withall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Behold the earth and the Heavens in the height of the beauty of the Spring, and in the ſtrength of the glory of the Sunne, how delightfull a ſight is it to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the works of Gods Creation
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170278:154"/>here below, the commonneſs of this ſight much abates the delight and wonder of it; but doubtleſs if a man that were born blind ſhould when he had attained to the full perfection of his age and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, be placed in a Paradiſe as <hi>Adam</hi> was, and ſhould ſee as ſoon as his eyes were opened, the earth adorned with all manner of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious flowers and trees laden with all manner of fruits, and the Sunne ſhining in its full ſtrength, how wonderfully delightfull would ſuch a ſight be? and if the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of God be ſo rich, how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is his throne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider the wonderfull manifeſtations and joyes that God hath beſtowed upon his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this life, they are unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and glorious: Some have cried out, Lord, either withhold
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:170278:154"/>thy comforts, or enlarge the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, for I am not able to bear my joys. We read of <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the manifeſtations that God gave him, drunk up his ſpirit, and made him ſick ſome dayes after, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.27. Such joys have been ſo great, that they have ſweetned the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt perſecutions; they have made them clap their hands for joy in the midſt of flames, and cry out in the raviſhment of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>O ye Papiſts you talk of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but here is a miracle, I am in the midſt of theſe flames as in a bed of Roſes.</hi> But alas what are the joys that God communicates to his people in this life, they are but as the drop of the bucket to the whole Ocean: the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that it doth not appear what we ſhall be.</hi> We would give if we had it a thouſand worlds, one would
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:170278:155"/>give all to enjoy theſe ſpiritual ſanctifying raviſhment of ſpirit one day; If theſe then are ſo ſweet, what are thoſe things that thou haſt lay'd up for them that love thee!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider, that God hath prepared theſe joyes, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to glorifie his goodneſs, and power, and wiſedom, in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring joys for his people worthy of his magnificence and love; he doth it for that end, that he may be glorified and admired in all his Saints; and what cannot infinite power and wiſedom, and what will not infinite love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do, when they ſet themſelves to prepare an entertainment, and to beſtow a reward that may ſet forth their greatneſs? What do Kings do in ſuch caſes? that which is accounted a feaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:170278:155"/>mongſt poor people, is a rich mans faſt. If the ſtrength of this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration were drawn forth, it would wonderfully affect us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider wherein theſe joys conſiſt for the negative part of them: There will be no ſickneſs, no pain, no death, no temporal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery or imperfection; nay, there ſhall be no ſinne, no temptations nor corruptions, no deſertions, no imperfections of graces, or duties, or comforts. What would a poor ſoul give to be delivered from this body of ſinne and death; there we ſhall ſee God cleerly, fully, everlaſtingly; there our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall be incomprehenſible, our union wonderfull and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and all ſhall be eternal. What a world of difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a dead carcaſs, and the ſame body when he liv'd? when it is
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:170278:156"/>dead, it is ſenſleſs, gaſtly, filthy: how beautifull, how active, how many rare endowments had it when it liv'd? and all theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the union of the ſoul with it; and if the ſoul which is but a poor creature by its union, doth communicate ſuch rare things to the body, what do we imagin will be communicated both to the body and the ſoul, when God ſhall be more neerly united to them then they are one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; when they ſhall be made more capable of receiving, and God will be more abundant in communicating.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Admire the love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God; O bleſſed God from the beginning of the world men have not perceived by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their ear, nor have they ſeen with their eyes, nor have any underſtood, ſave only thou O God, what thou haſt prepared for them that love thee; how haſt thou commended thy love to us, that we are thy Sons, but it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; O the length, and breadth, and height, and depth of thy love that cannot be known; Lord, what are our duties, or what are our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that thou ſhouldſt ſo highly reward them and us; our beſt
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170278:157"/>righteouſneſſe is as filthy rags, and for us we are worms, nay, a generation of vipers; Is it not enough that thou doſt not ſhake us off from thine hand of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence into hell fire, but that thou ſhouldſt lay ſuch Vipers in thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and warm us with thy love; Is it not enough for thee to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our rebellions, but that thou ſhouldſt give us ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: were it not a miracle of bounty and goodneſſe, for thee to bid us ſeriouſly to conſult and think what to ask of thee, and thou wouldſt give it us, though it were to the half of thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but that thou ſhouldſt ſet thy wiſedom on work in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and thy liberality in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch incomprehenſible rewards that we could neither ask nor think, but as farre as the heaven
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170278:157"/>is above the earth, ſo are thy thoughts of love above our thoughts; For thee to give thy Kingdom, thy Chriſt, thy ſelf, theſe are acts of goodneſſe; that art infinitely above us, yet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thee, that delighteſt to magnifie thy goodneſſe, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceſt over thy people as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over his Bride.</p>
                  <p>Deſpiſe the World, What are the things of this world O my Soul, what is there here to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired but ſinne and miſery, ſnares and temptations, vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and vexation of ſpirit, one hours communion with God, and the joys of the holy Ghoſt, that he hath given to his people in this world, are worth more then the world can know of; Why do we ſpend our ſtrength and money for
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170278:158"/>that which is not bread, and our labours for that which doth not ſatisfie: O vain world, God hath outbidden thee, thou offerſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, he offers me heaven for my love and ſervice, though my love be unworthy, too little for him, yet it is too much too good for thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Long for and breathe after heaven; As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God, My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living <hi>God,</hi> when ſhall I come and appear before God, when ſhall I be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from my abſence from thee, and from mine ignorance of thee; Make haſte O my beloved, and be thou like a Roe or a young Hart upon the mountains of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: The Spirit ſaith Come, and the Bride ſaith Come, and the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170278:158"/>Bridegroom ſaith, Surely I Come quickly, even ſo come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, come quickly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Encourage and ſtir up thy ſelf to the love and ſervice of God; Come O my Soul, Let us be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as we know that our labour is not in vain in the Lord; Let us not be weary of well doing, nor of the labour of love, for we ſhall reap if we faint not; We have known and in ſome meaſure endeavoured to ſerve God thus many years, were it not a ſad thing for the want of continuing one year, one moneth, it may be but one week, or one day more I ſhould loſe all my hopes and expectations of glory: God forbid; O my Soul, Let us encourage our ſelves in the Lord,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170278:159"/>we are not kept by our own but by the mighty power of God through faith to ſalvation; and be thou aſſured of this that the firſt minute thou art in heaven, thou ſhalt have ſuch full meaſure, pres't down, heapt up, and running over, that thou ſhalt break forth in the Songs of joy and praiſe to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, magnifying, admiring and adoring God that ever he gave thee leave and grace to ſerve him, then ſhalt thou ſee, and ſo thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſhall make thee confeſſe with joy and wonder, that the light afflictions and labours of love that thou endureſt in this life, are not worthy to be compared to the joys that ſhall be revealed in thee; When at any time thou beginneſt to be weary look to the price of thine high calling, and when thou comeſt to heaven thou

                  <p>O my Soul, theſe things cannot be beleeved and ſlighted, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and neglected; If thou doſt not beleeve them, what is the reaſon? Are they too glorious things for God to beſtow upon ſuch wretched ſinners? why doſt thou ſet bounds to the goodneſs of God, and ſay, Hitherto thou ſhalt go and no further, nay, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170278:160"/>ſince God hath ſaid that he will do that which ſhall glorifie his goodneſſe to his people, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibility of it makes it more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, but if thou art convinced of the truth, why art thou not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the excellencies of theſe joys? doſt thou not relliſh them? well, For the time to come I will meditate more of theſe things, I will by giving to the poor lay up my treaſures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, I will part with ſuch and ſuch vain delights for it, I will ſpend more time and communion with God in praiſing, admiring, and adoring of him, that if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by frequent performing of theſe duties, I may at laſt taſte and relliſh the incomprehenſible ſweetneſſe of them, that I may be enamoured more of heaven, and becauſe all my endeavours are

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:170278:165"/>his excellencies; If the Scripture had not ſpoke the thouſandth part of Chriſt as it doth, how could thy thoughts have been lower of him then they are; how could thy heart be more ſenceleſſe: It is a ſhame that every vanity ſhould ſteal away our hearts from Chriſt, much more abominable is it that our very ſins that murthered him ſhould ever prevail with us in the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Pray, Bleſſed God 'tis not in man by all his wiſedom and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to know or be affected with the Excellencies of Chriſt, if thou doſt not reveal them; If I had a thouſand worlds they were too ſmall a price for ſo great a mercy; O ſhew me thy ſelf and thy Sonne and it ſufficeth; And now O my Soul, are the Excellencies of Chriſt nothing unto us? Do we indeed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:170278:165"/>admire them? Surely all is but meer words and vain thoughts, if we do not ſtrive as farre as we may to imitate him in thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, for which we pretend to admire him; Are we patient as he was, meek, humble, holy, who when he was reviled reviled not again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We do but deceive our own ſouls in giving glorious titles and ſpeaking high things of Chriſt, and in the mean while not endeavour to transform into his Image; It is impoſſible we ſhould love him for his patience and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and not love patience and holineſſe, not yet never care to practiſe and get them; Therefore for the time to come the life of Chriſt ſhall be the example whereby I ſhall endeavour to frame mine: And that I may the better do ſo, I will reade over eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170278:166"/>the New Teſtament, and obſerve in every particular what Chriſt did, how he ſpoke to his Friends, to his Enemies, how he demeaned himſelf in every action, whether civil or natural, or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, how in all his Relations; And when I have written them down, I ſhall often peruſe them, and ſhall endeavour in every a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that I do, and word that I ſpeak, to remember if I can, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any parallel inſtance in the life of Chriſt, if there be, I ſhall make that my patern, and do likewiſe, but if there be none that I can think of, then I would do that which in my conſcience I think Chriſt would have done in like caſe.</p>

                  <p>I Found a great deal of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in writing this ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Meditation, not in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal or directory part, becauſe Chriſtian experience and ſtudy are things by which that party is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, but in the ſetting down of inſtances and examples therein I found the difficulty to lie: <hi>For Meditation is an harder work then to give Directions thereunto;</hi> aand I have generally found it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to ſtudy a day then to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate an hour, but of all the kindes of Meditation whereof Inſtances are ſet down in this Book, I found the greateſt difficulty in thoſe of
<pb facs="tcp:170278:167"/>
                     <hi>Solemne Occaſionall Meditations,</hi> they conſiſting for the moſt part of praier, which the devout ſoul when it hath ended forgets, ſo that if one might gain a world when the heart is overwhelmed with grief or inflamed with love, or raviſhed with joy, one could not remember the powrings out of the ſoul: In ſuch caſes one may ſay of ſuch Meditations as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe glorious things which he ſaw when he was wrapt into the third Heavens; they are neither lawful, nor poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be uttered, many times the ſecrets in our communion with God, are of that nature that it is not lawful by reaſon of that ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, nor poſſible to utter, becauſe the affections being ſo intenſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd invention, memory, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual actings of the Soul, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:170278:167"/>that time do almoſt quite ceaſe, and indeed whoſoever goes about to invent inſtances of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if it be only a learned man and not holy, his ſtudies may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his actings that way, but if it be an holy experienced Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, as his inward thoughts of love, joy, grief, and admirings of God are above all that his tongue doth or can utter, ſo thoſe ſecret ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which he uſeth between God and his own ſoul, when his thoughts are full of heaven, and of God, are much beyond what he can invent, or by ſtndy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; Therefore ſince thoſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are fulleſt of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be remembred, to ſet down Inſtances of Meditations, except one ſhould take them from ſome Saint as he was powring out his ſoul before God in ſecret; one
<pb facs="tcp:170278:168"/>can never ſet them fully down in ſecret I ſay; For the ſoul is never ſo free, nor may be before others as with God alone, and the truth is, if I had not had theſe Inſtances of <hi>Solemn Meditation</hi> by me, I think I ſhould hardly have ſet down any of that kinde; I ſhould only have referr'd him to the Pſalms, It was ſo that I wrote theſe from the mouth of one to whom though unſeen, I was oft times ſo near that I could hear his ſecreteſt devotions, if utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed though but with an ordinary voice, I am very confident for his part, he thought that none but God and his own Soul were privy to his Praiers, I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſidered it as a caſe of Conſcience, whether it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by ſtealth to hear, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to publiſh the private Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
<pb facs="tcp:170278:168"/>of others, but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much advantage it may bring to others, and how the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty himſelf can ſuffer nothing in it, his Name being concealed by me, I reſolve to publiſh them, beſides I very well know (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that the ſpiritual expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between God and ones own ſoul in ſecret, are forgotten al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as ended; It is very unlikely that any ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them ten years after, as the moſt of theſe are: I thought good to give an account of this matter, leſt I ſhould be thought to have that holy frame of heart which many of the expreſſions in theſe Meditations argues that he had that uſed them, and arrogate to my ſelf that which is farre from me.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:170278:169"/>
                  <p>If any ſhall be offended at the brevity and ſhortneſſe of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for this great and weighty buſineſſe of Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſhall only ſay thus much as to that:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That I am not willing to overcharge or affright new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners (for for ſuch I do very much intend this Treatiſe) with too great a number of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I would not have this ſwell above the bigneſſe of a Manuall, for I have often obſerved that when one hath perſwaded ſome to buy ſome Book, and told them it hath been but a ſmall price, it hath been almoſt as ſtrong a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (the ſmalneſſe of the price) as the goodneſſe of the Book: and I would not be willing that both theſe Motives ſhould be
<pb facs="tcp:170278:169"/>wanting to the Buying of this Book.</p>
                  <p>As for the plainneſſe of the Stile or matter, I ſhall thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it, if it oughto be excuſed, I wrote this for the meaneſt and ignoranteſt ſort of Chriſtians that they might buy, and underſtand it, that they might buy it, I have made it a Manuall that they might underſtand it, I have made it plain, and ſpoke to them in their own language, and to the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I ſay if any ſuch ſhall reade this Treatiſe, <hi>Indocti repiunt coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> and though I highly prize Learning, yet I know that as to praier and meditation, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of devotion wherein we keep a ſtrict Communion with God, and watch over our own ſouls, an experimental knowledge and acquaintance with, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd
<pb facs="tcp:170278:170"/>affections towards God will more avail us then all the Learning in the world, and doubtleſs it is not generally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in thoſe that live under Ordinances, but the <hi>non</hi>-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Truths we know, that will undoe us, if we did but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove theſe plain truths, <hi>viz.</hi> that God is, that there will be a Day of Judgement, that we muſt die, that we ought to love God with all our heart, with all our ſoul, with all our minde, with all our ſtrength, that we ſhould do as we would be done to; I ſay, if we did but improve theſe into practice, we ſhould attain to more holineſſe then if we knew a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more, and left thoſe truths (as generally men do) by them, as things forgotten, I doe very much think that the truths
<pb facs="tcp:170278:170"/>of Religion have been ſpun into too fine a thred of late daies, and ſome have obſerved that fewer have been converted of late years then formerly, when fundamentals have been plainly, powerfully and practically preſt upon the conſcience, it is an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to think that notions ſo they be ſpirituall, cannot be too acute or ſpeculative; I have one thing to entreat of the Chriſtian Reader, and it was one end of publiſhing this Treatiſe, that I might with it publiſh theſe my deſires, the thing that I am to requeſt of you will neither be charge nor trouble, It is your frequent, ſerious, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent praiers that I deſire of you; I know it is us'd too much as a complement among Chriſtians, to deſire prayers of their Chriſtian friends, and they are too often
<pb facs="tcp:170278:171"/>ſuperficially promis'd, and too ſeldom conſcienciouſly perform'd, nor would I have thee whoſoever thou art that feareſt God, account this my Requeſt as a thing of courſe, and that it is at thy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to grant it or no, for ſuppoſe a poor diſtreſſed man over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd and almoſt ſwallowed up with the ſenſe of his miſeries and wants, ſhould with tears and ſtrong importunities begge relief of thee; Doſt thou think it were an arbitrary thing (when it was in thy power) to relieve him or not? Mightſt thou not juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the the next time thou wentſt to pour out thy ſoul before God, that he ſhould keep by him the denial that thou gaveſt that poor man, and give it thee when thou in the diſtreſſed thoughts of thy heart, madſt thy praier to him,
<pb facs="tcp:170278:171"/>and doſt thou think that the Lord will hold thee guiltleſſe, when one whoſe afflictions are many corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, ſtrong temptations to <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> ſhall in the anguiſh and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of his ſpirit deſire thy praiers, and thou refuſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: Conſider whether at the day of judgement thou wilt have any ſufficient excuſe to pleade; I have ſometimes thought that the Bils that have publikely been put up for the praiers of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation have been too little regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it may be they have been too cuſtomarily and formally put up, it may be ſo, but it is not good for us to be Judges of evil thoughts, little do we know what terrouts and fears, and anguiſhes of ſpirit overwhelm them, while they are ſo little regarded by us, O that we were ſenſible of others afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:170278:172"/>and ſorrows whether ſpiritual or temporal, as they themſelves are, and as we would have them to be of ours were our ſouls in their ſouls ſtead, and if the Lord ſhould ſo by his providence order it as to bring us into thoſe ſtraits which we ſaw our Brother in, and would not afford him ſo much as our prayers, may we not juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect that the next time that we our ſelves are in ſtreights, our conſciences ſhould take up a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and taunting Proverb againſt us, and ſay as <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren did we are verily guilty concerning our Brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought us and we would not hear, therefore is all this diſtreſſe come upon us; And that which I would deſire thee to begge of God for me is, That he would give me
<pb facs="tcp:170278:172"/>ſincerely to aim at his glory in all my actions, but eſpecially thoſe that belong to my Miniſtry, that I might not be as a broken veſſell, and that he would give me greater diſcoveries of and love to himſelf and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that he would give me gifts, and ſtrength, and wiſedom, opportunity, and a heart to ſerve him, and mercies ſuitable to my wants, that mine afflictions may be ſanctified, my temptations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and my corruptions mortified.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I am to requeſt of thee, that is to do what I know too much neglected by my ſelf, and I fear by others; Thou art to pray for a bleſſing upon thy ſelf when thou readeſt this Treatiſe, and that God would make it a bleſſing unto others alſo into
<pb facs="tcp:170278:173"/>whoſe hands it ſhall come: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite you that you would help me with your praiers in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; When we do but take our ordinary daily bread we crave a bleſſing, how much more when we do things that concern our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall good; When we take a Book to that end ſpiritually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by it, do we think that it is in our own power, or in the power of any Treatiſe that we reade, (without Gods aſſiſtance) to do us good; Nay the Word of God it ſelf is but a dead Letter, if the holy Spirit be abſent when we hear or reade it: But that thou ſhouldeſt deſire a Bleſſing upon thy ſelf in reading of this Book is not all I requeſt of thee, but that thou wouldeſt alſo extend thy prayers further, even for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it may be alſo for their
<pb facs="tcp:170278:173"/>edification whoſoever ſhall reade it; For as we are to pray that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sermon we hear may be for the ſpirituall advantage of others as well as of our ſelves; It holds alſo in reading of Treatiſes of Devotion.</p>
